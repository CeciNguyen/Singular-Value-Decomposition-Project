#Singular-value decomposition
def my_svd(matrix, threshold=1e-10) -> dict:
    """
    Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the input matrix.
    Args:
        matrix (numpy.ndarray): The input matrix to be decomposed.
        threshold (float, optional): A threshold value to determine if singular values are close to zero.
            Singular values smaller than this threshold will be considered as zero.
            Default is 1e-10.
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the following components:
            - "U" (numpy.ndarray): The left singular vectors of the input matrix.
            - "S" (numpy.ndarray): A diagonal matrix containing the singular values.
            - "V" (numpy.ndarray): The right singular vectors of the input matrix (transpose of VT).
            - "Condition Number" (float): The condition number of the matrix based on singular values.
            - "Matrix Inverse" (numpy.ndarray): The matrix inverse computed using the SVD decomposition.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input matrix is singular (contains zero or near-zero singular values).
        np.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError: If a linear algebra error occurs during computation.
